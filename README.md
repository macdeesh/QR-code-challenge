## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I did the Mobile-first workflow for the first time, and i think that i will keep working with this method in the future it's finally more simple. In the beginning i start making flex-box and grid but couldn't get the result proposed by the challenge, then i tried something more simple like paddings and margins and it worked very well. I learned also about the Fallback color because when i just used the reference of color proposed by the challenge in hsl: **{background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);}** Atom editor showed an error massage saying: **"Fallback background-color (hex or RGB) should precede HSL background-color"**. So i figure out the same color hexadecimal code by using the HTML Color Picker in w3schools.com.

### Continued development

I would like to practice more flex-box, and use more bootstrap to style my elements. I want also to have a perfect responsivity to all the sizes.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I did the Mobile-first workflow for the first time, and i think that i will keep working with this method in the future it's finally more simple. In the beginning i start making flex-box and grid but couldn't get the result proposed by the challenge, then i tried something more simple like paddings and margins and it worked very well. I learned also about the Fallback color because when i just used the reference of color proposed by the challenge in hsl: **{background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);}** Atom editor showed an error massage saying: **"Fallback background-color (hex or RGB) should precede HSL background-color"**. So i figure out the same color hexadecimal code by using the HTML Color Picker in w3schools.com.

### Continued development

I would like to practice more flex-box, and use more bootstrap to style my elements. I want also to have a perfect responsivity to all the sizes.
